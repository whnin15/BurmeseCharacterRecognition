## Welcome to Burmese Character Recognition Project!

### Goal
In this project, we want to be able to classify the handwritten burmese characters using machine learning techniques. We will keep this code as open-source. Our goal is to remove the obstacle of the need for English characters in using software. We hope that this will help you.

If you want to contribute to this project, you can participate by emailing handwritten characters to us! We highly appreciate your help.

```
If you send us handwritten letter, here are some instructions.

- Please write ၁ to ၁၀, က to အ on a white paper.
- Please Leave space (~1cm) between each character.
- Take a picture and upload.

```

### Example Applications
Translation app - scan the letters in public places, for example, pagoda, and get them translated
Manage Receipts app - scan the receipts written in Burmese and organize them in your app
Keeping notes app - for those who like to write down instead of typing, but need to type it up for any reason, you can just scan your handwritten notes
